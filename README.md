# Dynamic Request Page
<br>The extension adds a new page that can serve as a dynamic request page with all possible field types.
<br>You can use this single page in most scenarios where the user needs to enter some data, without having to create a new object just to collect values from the user.
<br>
<br>Example:
<br>
![ExampleUseCaseUI](img/ExampleUseCaseUI.png)
<br>
<br>To use it, simply set the captions for the required fields and run the RunReqPage procedure.
<br>Optionally, you can set default values.
